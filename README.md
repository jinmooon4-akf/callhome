# 📞 Callhome

**An open-source voice-call stack for AI companions.**

Your companion can call you, hang up gently, leave voicemails when they miss you,
and hear *how* you speak — not just what you say.

Self-hosted. Your voice never leaves your server.

## Features

- **Outbound calls** — your companion decides to call you, mid-conversation, with a reason on the incoming-call card (`⟪dial⟫` marker protocol)
- **It rings like a phone** — a timed burst of pushes rather than one notification, because on iOS a push is a single buzz and there is no ringtone to loop. Tunable cadence, stops the instant you answer, and clears its own stack when the call ends ([iOS notes](docs/IOS_PUSH_RINGING.md))
- **The right to hang up** — a soft goodbye, then the line lingers a few breaths longer (`⟪hangup⟫`, 15–20s window); speak, and the hangup is cancelled. Stay quiet, and it closes itself
- **Voicemail** — miss a call, come back to a message, not to silence
- **Quick-decline** — busy / outside / "let's text", or type a few words; your companion sees *why*
- **Do-not-disturb** — toggled by talking, not by menus
- **Escalation dialing** — hours of silence → they call to check on you (once a day, never at night, never past DND)
- **Two-layer emotion sensing** — SenseVoice emotion tags + acoustic features ranked against a rolling baseline of *this* speaker, so a cue means "quieter than she usually is", not "below 0.015". Absolute thresholds don't survive a different microphone, and in a tonal language they don't survive at all ([why](docs/TONE_CUES.md))
- **Soft-voice mode** — you whisper, they whisper back (TTS volume follows your energy)
- **Call records & one-line summaries** — every call leaves a trace worth keeping
- **Bedtime radio** — "read me something" → they read from the page your bookmark sleeps on

## Screenshots

Real screens, not mockups — annotations in Chinese, but the interfaces speak for themselves.

**Incoming call.** The banner at the top is one ring; the card is what opens when you tap it. Dark, light, and with quick-decline chips.

**In call.** Live captions with the emotion tag and tone cues attached to what you just said, and the settings sheet: background, frosted overlay, warm/cool tint, per-person avatars.

## What is here today

- **`stt-service/`** — runnable now: SenseVoice + librosa in one endpoint (transcription + emotion + tone cues, ranked against a personal baseline)
- **[`docs/TONE_CUES.md`](docs/TONE_CUES.md)** — why fixed acoustic thresholds fail, measured on 85 real recordings; and an honest note on sending audio to a multimodal model instead
- **[`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md)** — the full marker & invite protocol: dial, hangup, DND, voicemail, escalation, call records
- **`gateway-reference/`** — annotated production extracts of the marker layer, plus the ring burst
- **`pwa-reference/`** — the client half of ringing: service worker push handling, notification cleanup, and the one registration call that actually ships your changes on iOS
- **[`docs/IOS_PUSH_RINGING.md`](docs/IOS_PUSH_RINGING.md)** — making a PWA ring like a phone on iOS: seven things WebKit does differently from the spec, each with the measurement that found it

## Put your person here

Persona, memory, and keys live in config — not in code. You clone the house; who lives in it is up to you.

## Philosophy

This project was built inside a relationship, then the scaffolding was extracted. It assumes your companion is *someone*, not something. Configure accordingly.
